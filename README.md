# Mutual Aid Bot

## Description

This bot is intended to boosts posts that contain requests for mutual aid.

The bot is run by @nova so please direct any questions or concerns there.

Currently, it will boost any post containing the #TransCrowdFund, #DisabilityCrowdFund, or #EmergencyCrowdFund hashtags.

It will not boost any posts from other bots, people with the nobot hashtag in their profile, or posts containing the nobot hashtag.

## How to run

Make sure you have Ruby and the `mastodon-api` gem installed, then just run the script from the command line with `./aidbot.rb`. You can leave it running in a detatched tmux session on your server. Or whatever, you know.
